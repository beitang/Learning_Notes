# Eloquent JavaScript - Second Edition

## Introduction
> But without care, a program size and complexity will grow out of control, confusing even the person who created it. Keeping programs under control is the main problem of programming. When a program works, it is beautiful. The art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity. The great program is subdued - made simple in its complexity.
> 
> A good programming language helps the programmer by allowing them to talk about the actions that the computer has to perform on a higher level. It helps omit uninteresting details, provides convenient building blocks, allows you to define your own building blocks, and make those blocks easy to compose.
> 
> In practice, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript can be used interchangeably - they are two names for the same language.
> 
> Web browsers are not the only platforms on which JavaScript is used. Some databae, such as MangoDB and CouchDB, use JavaScript as their scripting and query language. Several platforms for desktop and server programming, most notably the Node.js project are providing a powerful environment for programming JavaScript outside of the browser.
