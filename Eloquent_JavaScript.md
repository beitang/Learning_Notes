# Eloquent JavaScript - Second Edition

## Introduction
> But without care, a program size and complexity will grow out of control, confusing even the person who created it. Keeping programs under control is the main problem of programming. When a program works, it is beautiful. The art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity. The great program is subdued - made simple in its complexity.
> 
> A good programming language helps the programmer by allowing them to talk about the actions that the computer has to perform on a higher level. It helps omit uninteresting details, provides convenient building blocks, allows you to define your own building blocks, and make those blocks easy to compose.
> 
> In practice, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript can be used interchangeably - they are two names for the same language.
> 
> Web browsers are not the only platforms on which JavaScript is used. Some databae, such as MangoDB and CouchDB, use JavaScript as their scripting and query language. Several platforms for desktop and server programming, most notably the Node.js project are providing a powerful environment for programming JavaScript outside of the browser.

## Chapter 1: Values, Types, and Operators
### Values
> To be able to work with such quantities of bits without getting lost, you can separate them into chuncks that represent pieces of information. In a JavaScript environment, those chunks are called values. Though all values are made of bits, they play different roles. Every value has a type that determines its role. There are six basic types of values in JavaScript: numbers, strings, Booleans, objects, functions, and undefined values.
> 
> To create a value, you must merely invoke its name.
>
> Every value has to be stroed somewhere, and if you want to use a gigantic amount of them at the same time, you might run out of bits. Fortunately, this is a problem only if you need them all simultaneously. As soon as you no longer use a value, it will dissipate, leaving behind its bits to be recycled as building material for the next generation of value.
> 
> This chapter introduces the atomic elements of JavaScript programs, that is, the simple value types and the operators that can act on such values.
